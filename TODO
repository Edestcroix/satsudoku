- sud2sat and sat2sud both work out of the box when packaged, but
benchmark is not exposed as a command on installation yet, because it 
needs to be reworked to find data files and config files outside of 
the source tree.


to get this working, will need:
- **a new way of finding puzzle sets**, currently they are specified in a config file
  relative to the source tree, but this needs to be changed. It could be as simple as
  changing puzzleDir in the config.

- as an idea, could specify puzzle sets at runtime by passing the filename as an argument and require a header line in 
  the puzzle set file to specify the test info that is currently in the config file.

- would then need to remove the puzzle set info from the config file, and add a parser to read the data
  that would have been in the config from the header line in the puzzle set file.

- another idea: **work the script to expect to be called in a specially organized directory** with
  puzzle sets and a config file specifying info for each set. This would probably be better
  as it could use the same config parsing it already has.

- **a new way of finding the config file**, currently it hardcoded. The config file should 
  be looked for in ~/.config/satsudoku or something, and if not found there should be
  some way of providing defaults. This could tie into the idea above of having tests and config
  being required in the directory the script is called from.
